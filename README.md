Things to do when you clone or pull the repo:

Create local database:
- Double-click on properties, in "Package/Publication SQL" activate the page, create a connection called NewCo and check the box right under "informations about the source database" (Infos sur la bdd source).
- go in the NuGet console and do Upddate-Database then enter (that's it the database should be set).

Package to install beforehand, do in console package NuGet:
- Install-Package FluentValidation.MVC5 -Version 6.1.0 
- Install-Package jQuery.Validation


Notes:

Download sqlloaderdb.msi for local databases management, here https://www.microsoft.com/fr-FR/download/details.aspx?id=29062 .

Remember to go in the control management package in the Project (I think), to update the database, entering Update-Migration.

To better understand how to handle foreign key see these model architecture:

This one didn't really helped but gonna try to make it work later: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22297097/how-to-add-a-foreign-key-reference-to-asp-net-mvc-5-identity .
Do not forget that when you've got more than one primary key in your class your have to order them (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/jj591583#Composite).
